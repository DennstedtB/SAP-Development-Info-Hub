# SAP Development Info Hub

Inspired by Michael Kellers [Eclipse ADT info hub](https://github.com/Keller-Michael/Eclipse_ADT_info_hub) this should be an info hub about every SAP development topic. You should find helpful information to start with several topics.
Everyone is invited to add more blogs and content.

If you want to add some knowledge to this repository, but you don't know how you can have a look at this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/01/28/github-markdown-visual-studio-code-and-git-to-share-knowledge/) to get an overview how you can contribute to a Github project and work with Markdown-Files.
